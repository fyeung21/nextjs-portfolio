      "Forever a student in life and its subjects, I've eventually found myself stumbling upon web and app development. This opened me up to not only the world of computer languages, but also the passionate and innovative community it comes with. I enjoy front end development and using reusable React components to build interfaces or platforms for users to interact with comfortably. Overall, I am an easy going individual who is very goal oriented and strives to get things done while acknowledging that there is always room for improvement.",
